# Visualising-Software-Engineering
An Assignment graphing Github API data through the use of d3.js

## How to install and run
To run the project, clone the code and just open the index.html file.
I decided to build this is plain HTML, CSS and JS for the ease of running the assignmrnt for my lecturers

## What the website consists of
Open finishing the assignment, a user should be able to input a the name of a github user/company (eg. Me or facebook) and see some data about that user visualised in the carousel

### Social graph
The first slide is a social graph. The graph contains blue nodes which represent the repos belonging to the selected user. It also contains orange nodes which are the top 30 contributers in each of the repos. These orange nodes are then linked to all the repos taht they have contributed to. The social graph is built as a force directed graph as shown below in the apendix.
